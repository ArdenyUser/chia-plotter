# chia-plotter (pipelined multi-threaded)

This is a new implementation of a chia plotter which is desinged as a processing pipeline,
similar to how GPUs work, only the "cores" are normal software CPU threads.

As a result this plotter is able to fully max out any storage device's bandwidth,
simply by increasing the number of "cores", ie. threads.

## Usage

```
For <poolkey> and <farmerkey> see output of `chia keys show`.
<tmpdir> needs about 220 GiB space, it will handle about 25% of all writes. (Examples: './', '/mnt/tmp/')
<tmpdir2> needs about 110 GiB space and ideally is a RAM drive, it will handle about 75% of all writes.

Usage:
  chia_plot [OPTION...]

  -n, --count arg      Number of plots to create (default = 1, -1 = infinite)
  -r, --threads arg    Number of threads (default = 4)
  -u, --buckets arg    Number of buckets (default = 128)
  -t, --tmpdir arg     Temporary directory, needs ~220 GiB (default = $PWD)
  -2, --tmpdir2 arg    Temporary directory 2, needs ~110 GiB [RAM] (default = <tmpdir>)
  -d, --finaldir arg   Final directory (default = <tmpdir>)
  -p, --poolkey arg    Pool Public Key (48 bytes)
  -f, --farmerkey arg  Farmer Public Key (48 bytes)
      --help           Print help
```

Make sure to crank up `<threads>` if you have plenty of cores, the default is 4.
Depending on the phase more threads will be launched, the setting is just a multiplier.

RAM usage depends on `<threads>` and `<buckets>`.
With default `<buckets>` and 4 threads it's ~2GB total, with 16 threads it's ~6GB total.

## How to Support

I developed this on my own time, even though I already filled all my HDDs (~50 TiB) with the official (slow) plotter.

## Results

On a dual Xeon(R) E5-2650v2@2.60GHz R720 with 256GB RAM and a 3x800GB SATA SSD RAID0, using a 110G tmpfs for `<tmpdir2>`:

## How to Verify

To make sure the plots are valid you can use the `ProofOfSpace` tool from `chiapos`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos.git
cd chiapos && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8
./ProofOfSpace check -f plot-k32-???.plot [num_iterations]
```

## Future Plans

I do have some history with GPU mining, back in 2014 I was the first to open source a XPM GPU miner,
which was about 40x more efficient than the CPU miner. See my other repos.

As such, it's only a matter of time until I'll add OpenCL support to speed up the plotter even more,
keeping most of the load off the CPUs.

## Dependencies

- cmake (>=3.14)
- libgmp3-dev
- libsodium-dev

## Install

Ubuntu 20.04
```
sudo apt install  -y libsodium-dev  libgmp3-dev  cmake g++ git
git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter.git 
cd  chia-plotter
git submodule update --init
./make_devel.sh
```

The binaries will end up in `build/`, you can copy them elsewhere freely (on the same machine, or similar OS).

## Known Issues

- Doesn't compile with gcc-11, use a lower version.
- Needs at least cmake 3.14 (because of bls-signatures)
